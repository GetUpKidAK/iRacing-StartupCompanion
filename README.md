# iRacing Startup Companion

Startup Companion launches applications to run alongside iRacing, similar to [iRacing Manager](https://forums.iracing.com/discussion/567/iracingmanager-tool-manager-for-iracing), but aimed primarily at anything that needs to be opened **before** iRacing is launched. You could even add the iRacing UI to launch along with any tools you need active, then just join a session and you're ready to race.

As a VR-user, I need to launch SteamVR before iRacing is running, and since Crew Chief and overlay apps can be opened before iRacing is active, I can launch all of these apps at once and then join a session, which saves me waiting for them to launch and clicking each of them individually. There's also an option to add a delay between opening apps if you need one app to be active before another works (e.g. SteamVR changes my mic input which Crew Chief uses).

- Launches .exe or .lnk (Windows shortcut) files
- Possible to delay startup or exit of application
- Can launch applications individually if an app crashed or updated
- Support for command-line arguments, if needed
